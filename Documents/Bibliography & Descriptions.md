# Comparing Machine Learning Classificaiton Approaches for Predicting Expository Text Difficulty
## Abstract
- "This study compared the accuracy of four classification machine learning approaches
(flat, one-vs-one, one-vs-all, and hierarchical) using natural
language processing features in predicting human ratings of
text difficulty for two sets of texts"
- "The hierarchical classification was the most accurate for the two text sets considered
individually (Set A, 77.78%; Set B, 82.05%), while the nonhierarchical
approaches, one-vs-one and one-vs-all, performed similar to the hierarchical classification for the
combined set (71.43%)."
- "These findings suggest both promise
and limitations for applying hierarchical approaches to
text difficulty classification. It may be beneficial to apply a
recursive top-down approach to discriminate the subsets of
classes that are at the top of the hierarchy and less related,
and then further separate the classes into subsets that may
be more similar to one other. These results also suggest that
a single approach may not always work for all types of datasets
and that it is important to evaluate which machine
learning approach and algorithm works best for particular
datasets. The authors encourage more work in this area to
help suggest which types of algorithms work best as a func-
tion of the type of dataset."
## conclusion 
- "These experiments
demonstrated the potential of using hierarchical approaches
in text difficulty classification, but also indicated that no
one single approach was most accurate."
-"When classifying Set A and Set B text sets independent-
ly, the most accurate approach was hierarchical classification.
However, when the two text sets were combined, one-
vs-one, one-vs-all, and hierarchical approaches performed
similarly."
