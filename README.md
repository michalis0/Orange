## Project Description 📝
This project aims at building a model for predicting the level of difficulty of a French text for native English speakers interested in learning French and wanting to improve their reading skills in French as a foreign language. The level of difficulty could then be used in a recommendation system, to recommend texts at the appropriate level for French learners. It has been shown that learners progress more easily if they read texts that are at the just right level of difficulty, rather than being presented with a text that has too many new words, or too little.

## Method 💡

## Data 📊
The dataset to train and test the model include labeled sentences in French. We collected a set of over 1000 annotated sentences, while keeping a balance in the difficulty levels from A1 to C2 (using as a reference the Common European Framework of Reference, CEFR). The sentences come from a rich mix of sources such as annotated exam preparation papers, corrected grammar exercises from text books, labelled newspapers and transcripts of radio interviews:
